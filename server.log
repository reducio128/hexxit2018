2017-12-15 17:09:55 [WARNING] The server will make no attempt to authenticate usernames. Beware.
2017-12-15 17:09:55 [WARNING] While this makes the game possible to play without internet access, it also opens up the ability for hackers to connect with any username they choose.
2017-12-15 17:09:55 [WARNING] To change this, set "online-mode" to "true" in the server.properties file.
